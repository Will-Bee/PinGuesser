# PinGuesser
Just thing i did while learning Python

you can see efficiency of BruteForce strategy here

# How to use



`main(1234, 4, False, True)`

`main(passwd, length, console_output, live_output)`

passwd = your pin

lenght = lenght of that pin

console_output = print some basic data

live_output = console output of guessing, disable for better performance
