# PinGuesser
Just thing i did while learning Python

# How to use

Down in script you can see calling function main(), where you enter two numbers and turn on / off ui, number itself, how long number it is and True or False to turn on / off  ui (True = ui is on, False = ui is off)
here is little issue i will not fix, so i tell you how to "fix" it yourself

if your pin is starting with ZERO ( 0 ), for example 0123, type only 123 as pin and tell the program it is 4 digits pin (it will guess like you typed 0123)

this is only thing with tells you how safe are your pins on smartphones etc.

anyways, noone can try 1 000 pins / second in real life, so i thing you can trust your random-generater 8-digits pin like noone else
